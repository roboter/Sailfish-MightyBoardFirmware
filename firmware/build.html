The "Generation3" firmware is the firmware used by MakerBot's Generation 3 and
Generation 4 electronics.
</p>
<h1 id="toc0"><span>Building the firmware from source</span></h1>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Getting ready to build</span></h2>
<p>To build and install the firmware, you'll need these tools:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The avr-gcc compiler and library</li>
    <li>avrdude, a tool for uploading hex files</li>
    <li>scons, a build tool</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toc2"><span>Fedora</span></h3>
<p>
    If you're running Fedora, you can install the whole toolchain with one command
    (as root):
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>yum install avr-gcc avr-libc avrdude scons git</code>
</pre>
</div>
<h3 id="toc3"><span>Ubuntu/Debian</span></h3>
<p>
    If you're running some flavor of Debian, you can easily install all three from
    the standard repositories:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude scons</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br />
If you don't already have Git installed, the package git-core should provide it,
at least in Ubuntu.
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>apt-get install git-core</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br />
should do it.
<h3 id="toc4"><span>OS X</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        install jmil's new
        <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://github.com/downloads/jmil/MacAVR/AVR_0018.pkg">MacAVR</a>
        package, which installs the latest avr-gcc and avrdude from Arduino at
        /usr/local/avr and updates your PATH in ~/.bash_profile to point there. If
        MacAVR doesn't work for you, you can install manually by using the versions
        of avr-gcc and avrdude that are bundled with Arduino. See the discussion
        <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://groups.google.com/group/gen3-firmware-development/browse_thread/thread/f3b78dace01bc7be">here</a>
        for using avr tools from
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-0018.dmg">Arduino
            0018</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        You will need to build scons yourself: First
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://www.macports.org/install.php">Install MacPorts</a>,
        then
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://scons.darwinports.com/">run the command listed on
            Darwinports for building scons</a>:
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>sudo port install scons</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
    It will take a while (~30 min) for MacPorts to build and install SCons along
    with all of its dependencies.
</p>
<p>
    That's everything you need. After installation (and a reboot), check that each
    package was installed correctly in a new Terminal window with the "which"
    command:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>% which avr-gcc
/usr/local/avr/bin/avr-gcc
% which avrdude
/usr/local/avr/bin/avrdude
% which scons
/opt/local/bin/scons</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
    Note: As of 2010-04-19 avr-gcc and avrdude on Darwin ports are not able to
    build the v2 software. Use instructions above instead.<br />

</p>
<h3 id="toc5"><span>Windows</span></h3>
<p>
    If you're using Windows, you can use the versions of avr-gcc and avrdude that
    are bundled with Arduino, or install them yourself:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://winavr.sourceforge.net/">AVR-GCC and avrdude for
            Windows</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://www.scons.org/">SCons site</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc6"><span>Get the source</span></h2>
<p>
    There are two ways to do this: download a tagged zip/tarball, or pull down the
    latest source.
</p>
<h3 id="toc7"><span>Getting the latest source</span></h3>
<p>
    You can get the latest code from the
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://github.com/makerbot/G3Firmware/">G3Firmware github
        repository</a>. First
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://git-scm.com/download">install git</a>, and then clone the
    tree:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>git clone git://github.com/makerbot/G3Firmware.git</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
    If you're new to git, definitely check out the
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://git-scm.com/documentation">tutorials</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you've already cloned the tree in the past, you can update it by changing
    to the G3Firmware directory and typing:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>git pull</code>
</pre>
</div>
<h3 id="toc8"><span>Getting a tagged zip or tarball</span></h3>
<p>
    If you don't have git installed or don't want to install it, you can get a
    tagged build from the
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132711/http://github.com/makerbot/G3Firmware/downloads">GitHub download
        page</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="toc9"><span>Running the build</span></h2>
<p>
    Once avr-g++, scons, and avrdude are in your path, you're pretty much ready to
    go. Switch to the
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>G3Firmware/firmware</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br />
directory and type:
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>scons</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br />
to build the motherboard firmware. If you have a cable hooked up to the board,
you can upload the firmware with the scons script:
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>scons port=/dev/NAME_OF_YOUR_SERIAL_DEVICE upload</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br />
You'll have to manually press the reset button on the board as you run the
upload.
<p>
    If you are trying to build firmwares for motherboards other than the default
    Thing-O-Matic board, you can define the platform you want to compile for with:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code># Generation 3 RepRap Motherboard v1.2
scons platform=rrmbv12
# Generation 4 MakerBot Motherboard w/ Arduino Mega
scons platform=mb24
# Generation 4 MakerBot Motherboard w/ Mega 2560
scons platform=mb24-2560</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>You'll also have to define the platform when you upload to a board.</p>
<p>
    Building and uploading the extruder firmware is similar. Just specify an
    extruder controller as the platform:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>scons platform=ecv22
scons platform=ecv22 port=/dev/NAME_OF_YOUR_SERIAL_DEVICE upload</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
    Like the motherboard, if you need to upload to any extruder board that is not
    the default Cupcake board you need to define the platform:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code># Generation 3 extruder controller
scons platform=ecv22
# Generation 4 extruder controller
scons platform=ecv34</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
    You can also define whether or not the board will be using relays or stepper
    extruders using the "relays=false" or "stepper=true" tags.
</p>
<p>
    Don't forget you'll have to manually press the reset button on the board as
    you run the upload.
</p>
<p>
    Remember, to upload to an extruder board, you must have your USB-serial cable
    connected correctly to the extruder board itself! You cannot program an
    extruder board via the motherboard.
